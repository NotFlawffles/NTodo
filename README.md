has another commands, `$ ntodo` to list them.

this is how the `.ntodos` file looks like, which stores the TODOs in it

# Installation
to install it into /usr/bin to be used anytime simply:

`git clone https://github.com/notflawffles/ntodo && cd ntodo && make install`

# Extra
some thing really useful i use is letting NTodo list the TODOs at the startup of the terminal, by adding this to my `.bashrc`:

`ntodo list`

how easy.
